# graphhopper_custom_profile

Dear Community,
i want to implement a new custom profile to my graphhopper 0.13 project. The profile works, its compiled and packages and as *.jar imported to my app. As default profile graphhopper is using the car profile. My question is: Where can i change the default profile to my custom profile or how do i change the code above to use my profile. The commented lines are different tries but every time another exception appears. For example "FlagEncoder not yet initialzed", "FlagEncoder does not match" or "No configuration changes are possible after loading the graph". If I should be more specific about anything just ask and i'll try to answer properly.

Kind regards
Chamflo
